## Together we can do more!


We are an informal group of culture animators, artists, scientists, activists and constructors. We represent several local organizations, including the Hevelianum Science Center and Hackerspace Trójmiasto.

[Hevelianum](https://hevelianum.pl/) is a place where science meets history. It offers interactive scientific exhibitions in the 19th-century buildings of the former military fort.

[Hackerspace Trójmiasto](https://hs3.pl/) is a community of technology enthusiasts and designers bringing together everyone who wants to develop, share knowledge and build an open technological space.

[L'arT](https://lartagency.com/) is a creative art agency and online gallery that not only connects artists with potential clients, but also creates amazing art projects, initiates collaborations and events.

## Where did the idea for the festival come from?

It started one day in November, during Idea Squash, an event organized by [Hackerspace Trójmiasto](https://hs3.pl/) and [Institute of Urban Culture in Gdańsk](https://ikm.gda.pl/). Leszek from [Hackerspace Trójmiasto](https://hs3.pl/) presented his dream: to create a room without color, i.e. an installation in which objects become invisible thanks to a specific spectrum of light. And it began… constructive feedback, specific suggestions and practical advice on improving the project. The idea slowly evolved, each of the participants of the event had their own vision, and one idea provoked another. It turned out that many of us have had various projects in one way or another in mind for a long time - from playing with analog photography, through experiments with UV light, to laser shows. Then it dawned on us: one installation is not enough – we have to create a festival!

## And then there was light

In May 2022, we achieved our goal - we organized the first edition of the Festival of Light, which took place on the weekend of May 13-15 in Góra Gradowa.

The event was attended by over 2,500 people, and as many as 370 participants attended the workshops. We have prepared 20 attractions on the border of art, science and technology. Many institutions were involved in the organization of the festival, e.g. [Polish Space Agency](https://polsa.gov.pl/), astronomical journal [Urania - Postępy Astronomii](https://www.urania.edu.pl/), [Łukasiewicz Institute](https://lukasiewicz.gov.pl/) and [Metropolitan Institute](https://www.im.edu.pl/) and over 20 interdisciplinary artists from 8 countries, including representatives of the prestigious [University of the Arts London: Central Saint Martins](https://www.arts.ac.uk/colleges/central-saint-martins).

**This year we have an appetite for even more!**
