The Gdańsk Light Festival is a transdisciplinary event that merges art, science, and technology, celebrated on the occasion of the UNESCO International Day of Light. The festival is organized by independent cultural animators, artists, makers, and scientists associated with 3 Tricity organizations: [Hackerspace Trójmiasto](https://hs3.pl/), [Hevelianum](https://hevelianum.pl/), and [L'arT Agency](https://lartagency.com/pl). In partnership with organizations such as the Polish Space Agency, UNESCO, CODE:ME Foundation, and Gdansk University of Technology, we have hosted numerous lectures, workshops, exhibitions, and shows that creatively engage with light.

In previous editions, we managed to present a total of 55 attractions at the intersection of art, science, and technology, created by 90 artists, makers, and scientists from Poland and abroad. Additionally, we organized 41 workshop sessions with over 800 participants. Overall, our events have attracted several thousand participants  (approximately 2,500 for the first edition and 3,500 for the second edition). More information about previous editions can be found on our [website](https://festiwalswiatla.hs3.pl/) and [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Festiwalswiatla).
