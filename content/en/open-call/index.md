## We announce an Open Call!

 The organizers of the Gdańsk Festival of Light are pleased to invite artists who explore the theme of light to co-create the event. We encourage creators from Poland and Europe to submit works in any form that address the theme of this year's festival, which is "Light in Our Lives." Selected works will be presented during the third edition of the festival on May 10-11, 2024.
 
 In our daily lives, we often overlook the significant role that light plays. 
 
 Have you ever wondered how big of a role light plays in your life? Its primary source - the Sun - makes life on Earth possible, and thanks to human inventions such as the kerosene lamp, the light bulb, and the laser, civilization continues to evolve. Throughout the centuries, light has fascinated both scientists and artists, who have repeatedly analyzed and captured its essence. During the Light Festival, we aim to explore their work. We want to showcase the various aspects of light present in almost every aspect of life - from its role in nature to its influence on art and the possibilities it opens up in science and technology.


 **We are looking for:** paintings, prints, photographs, small artistic installations, light installations, sound installations, visual mapping projects (up to 10 minutes), music projects, theater performances, performative actions, and other activities related to the festival's main theme. We are open to experiments at the intersection of art, science, and technology.

**In your work, you can:**
 
🔆 🌳 focus on the beauty of light and color in nature 

🔆 📶 utilize new light-based technologies 

🔆 🎭 delve into the role of light in art and culture 

🔆 🌃 address the issue of light pollution 

🔆 🏥 demonstrate how light (or its absence) affects health and well-being 

🔆 🌇 explore the role of light in design and architecture 

🔆 🛰 focus on the lights of the universe observed through a telescope


**About the festival:**

 The Festival of Light is a transdisciplinary event that combines art, science, and technology, organized on the occasion of the UNESCO International Day of Light. The festival is created by a group of independent cultural animators, artists, makers, and scientists gathered around 3  organizations from Tricity: [Hackerspace Trójmiasto](https://hs3.pl/), [Hevelianum](https://hevelianum.pl/) and [L’art Agency](https://lartagency.com/pl). In collaboration with partners such as the Polish Space Agency, UNESCO, CODE:ME Foundation, and Gdańsk University of Technology, we have organized numerous lectures, workshops, exhibitions, and shows that in various ways resonate with the theme of light. In previous editions of the festival, we managed to present a total of 55 attractions at the intersection of art, science, and technology prepared by 90 artists, makers, and scientists from Poland and abroad. We also organized 41 workshops with over 800 participants. In total, our events have attracted several thousand participants (around 2,500 for the first edition and 3,500 for the second edition). More information about previous editions can be found on our website and Facebook page.
