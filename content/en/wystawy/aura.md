Light is energy. Each of us radiates this energy. It can be perceived, captured in a photograph, and shared with others. We call this human energetic aura. A series of paintings by Mariusz Gosławski presents energetic portraits of eight individuals.
According to the author, the aura is nothing more than an energetic portrait of a person. Its colour reflects one's personality. An individual with a dominant blue aura is brilliant, violet suggests loftiness, while red indicates goal-orientedness. The colour of the aura mirrors character and emotions of a person. Anyone can see it; all it takes is a bit of patience and determination.
