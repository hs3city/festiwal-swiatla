Che ci facciamo qui is a video installation where a large-scale painting, echoing the spirit and atmosphere of Tiepolo (one of the great masters of Venetian decorative painting), becomes an open field for numerous interpretations through a continuous emergence of neo-technological suggestions. 
Classical painting and modern video mapping engage in dialogue, creating a narrative that doesn't offer straightforward explanations but is rich in hidden meanings. Time and human presence flow in an "timeless story," that oscillates between a mythological past, contemporaneity, and possible futures. The work remains open to experimentation and continuous metamorphosis, always in motion between ancient and modern.
