The laser harp is an innovative musical instrument that, besides generating sounds, also creates visual effects. Built-in sensors in the instrument track the player's finger movements above the laser beam. These movements induce changes in the magnetic field, which in turn generates sound and visual effects.

Joanna Zubrycka's interactive sound installation will provide a unique opportunity to play this incredible instrument. By utilizing samples of the artist's vocals, the harp will respond to the audience's gestures and generate unique sound and visual effects in real-time.
