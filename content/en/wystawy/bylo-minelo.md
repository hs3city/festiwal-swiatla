The inspiration behind Magdalena Ferdyn's work was finding a disco ball in one of the pawn shops in Bytom. The randomly encountered object became the stimulus for creating an installation composed of hundreds of small mirrors. With each movement, they reveal more reflections of the surrounding world.
The work portrays a popular party snack, a cheese skewer, which, removed from its typical context, acquires a radiant glow and gains a completely new significance.
