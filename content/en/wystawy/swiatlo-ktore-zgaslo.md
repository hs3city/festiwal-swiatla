## ROBERT PROCH: The Light That Faded Too Soon

Robert Proch, also known as Tone, was a Polish painter, animator, and one of the most recognized street art creators of the young generation. Proch's art never fit into rigid frameworks. It defied - and continues to defy - traditional labels, categories, and simple classifications. It's the kind of art that  moves, challenges, unsettles,, and delights all at once. It's the kind of art that leaves no one indifferent.
Proch was renowned for his unconventional style, blending elements of graffiti, street art, and painting. His distinctive, vibrant murals enriched the urban landscapes of many cities in Poland and around the world, including Paris, Rome, Łódź, and Los Angeles. Tone was also the first Polish artist to have a solo exhibition at the iconic London gallery of Steve Lazarides, a collaborator and curator of Banksy.
His promising career was tragically cut short by his premature death in 2019. Robert Proch was an extraordinary artist and individual whose talent and dedication could captivate anyone. Though he departed too soon, his art continues to live on, moving and inspiring the young generation of artists.
The exhibition was organized in collaboration with the Robert Proch Foundation.



### EXHIBITION AND ANIMATION OF ROBERT PROCH'S WORKS
Wozownia, 1st floor
The exhibition will feature reproductions of the artist's most famous murals, accompanied by animations of his works created by Joanna Tadych and Kinga Marszaukowska. Using artificial intelligence, the authors have brought characters and elements from Proch's paintings to life, highlighting the evolution that occurred in the artist's work during a short span of his career.
An additional feature of the exhibition will be a ceiling light installation, serving as a carrier of light and colors of the images appearing on the screen, thus enhancing the dynamic character of Robert Proch's works. 
The entire space will pulsate in sync with the displayed images, allowing viewers to immerse themselves in the world created by the artist and unveil its hidden meanings.

Robert Proch was acclaimed not only for his large-scale works but also for his animated films. In his portfolio, he had three short films: “Fugu” from 2008, 
“Wirus” from 2009, and “Galeria” from 2010, for which he received the award for the best animated film at the Curta Cinema International Short Film Festival in Rio de Janeiro (2011) and the 2nd prize at the Animocje Animated Film Festival (2012). During the festival, we will screen all three productions, as well as his short animations: “Harmonia”, “Kultura”, and “Sand, Sand, Pile of Sand”.

### DOCUMENTARY FILM
Friday 18:30
Saturday 18:00
Wozownia, 1st floor

The festival will also feature a documentary about the artist's life.

PROCH is a documentary about Robert Proch (1986-2019) – recognized as one of the most eminent figures in urban art worldwide.

It's a story of an artist who was always on the move, who embraced risk and never compromised on his journey. His art underwent constant transformation, and eventually he lost himself in his quest for change and new forms of artistic expression. 

But above all, PROCH is a tale of a man. A husband, a father, a friend. Through the words of those who surrounded Robert, who got to know the person behind the artist. People he loved and who loved him back. It's a narrative of an extraordinary life that ended too soon…
