The photo features Daniel Saulski, an actor, soloist, director, and most importantly, a devoted enthusiast of Gdańsk. Locals know him as the pirate Daniel from the Motława River. The actor collaborates with reenactment groups, promoting Gdańsk's maritime heritage. He's an extraordinary character. Despite the passing years, with the energy of a twenty-year-old, he participates in the city's life, entertaining and inspiring successive generations of Gdańsk inhabitants with his humor.

Although, as he puts it, being a pirate is his calling, Saulski has a impressive acting portfolio. For 15 years, he was associated with the Musical Theatre in Gdynia, where he was a soloist. He also performed at the theatre in Lublin and collaborated with many other institutions, both as an actor and a director.
