Cyberskakanka (Cyberhopscotch) is a project of Hackerspace Trójmiasto created for the inaugural edition of the Festival of Light. It was inspired by carefree childhood games and the illuminated dancefloors of American discotheques from the '70s. The installation consists of glowing modules, each composed of four pressure-sensitive tiles, enabling interactive entertainment.

This year, Cyberhopscotch makes a comeback! The project inspired the creators of "Slithering to Success", a game developed during this year's Game Jam, who decided to use one of its modules as a… joystick.

"Slithering to Success" is a music game inspired by productions such as "Guitar Hero" and "Dance Dance Revolution", created by high school students from Tricity. Players follow on-screen commands and move on the Cyberhopscotch tiles. What's it all about?


### Slithering to Success

How can you communicate when you can't speak? Through the universal language of music, of course! For Snek the snake, life among humans has always been a challenge. Misunderstood and rejected from the orchestra, his dream of a musical career seemed dashed. Help him realize it by assembling the greatest band the world has ever seen!
But beware, to convince your new friends, you must first defeat them in a musical duel. Hop onto the cyberhopscotch and press the arrows to the rhythm. Just be careful not to miss a beat! Snek wouldn't want to miss another chance to become a famous musician!
