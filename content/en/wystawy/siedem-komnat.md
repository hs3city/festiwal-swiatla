The Seven Rooms performance draws inspiration from the military history of Gradowa Mountain. While rooted in historical context, it expands its narrative to address contemporary issues.
Audiences will witness mysterious strategic games unfolding simultaneously within distinct rooms. The use of specific lighting will create a unique atmosphere.
The project emerged from a collaboration between the Basic Design Studio of the Sculpture and Intermedia Department at the Academy of Fine Arts in Gdańsk and Hackerspace Trójmiasto. The project's creators include:
Prof. Małgorzata Kręcka-Rozenkranz, Ph.D., who leads the workshop, and Mgr Paulina Stokowska, serving as an assistant. Second-year Sculpture students participating in the Basic Design Workshop program and volunteers were invited to participate in the project.

Performers: Małgorzata Kręcka- Rozenkranz,  Paulina Stokowska, Martyna Rutkowska, Karol Zagórowski, Wiktoria Gawin, Hanna Schroeder, Małgorzata Kupper, Maria Zberovskaya, Alicja Zdrojewska, Klaudia Osmałek, Liza Osmałek.
