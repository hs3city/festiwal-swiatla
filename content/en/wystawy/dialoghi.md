Dialoghi di fumo is a video installation where smoke, painted in oil on canvas, comes to life through the use of new technologies. The artwork was designed within the spaces of the former Ansaldo-Breda factory, which produced heavy metallurgy generating smoke. The workers were immersed in the smoke.
Smoke, since prehistoric times, has been a metaphor for human activities, which can be constructive or destructive. Through the smoke, a space of nature transforms into a landscape of culture.
