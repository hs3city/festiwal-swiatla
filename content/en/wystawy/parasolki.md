The Umbrellas is one of those projects that start small but eventually evolve into something truly spectacular. The first LED umbrellas were created for last year's festival as part of the HS3 Presents exhibition. The concept resonated so well with the audience that members of the Hackerspace Tricity decided to expand it. Thus, a plan emerged. The idea was to create an installation comprising numerous synchronized glowing umbrellas with programmable animation. Many were involved in bringing this ambitious project to life. To accomplish the mission, Hackerspace organized a series of workshops allowing participants to construct their own umbrellas under the guidance of an instructor.

The results will be on display in the courtyard of Hevelianum. The Umbrellas will cast their glow over the heads of the audience, where they can be admired during the festival's shows and concerts.
