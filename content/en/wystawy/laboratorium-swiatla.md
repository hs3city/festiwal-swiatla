Color and light are an inseparable duo. It's through light that we perceive the world in vibrant hues. Without light, colors cease to exist. But why is that? What defines the colors we perceive? And is the world around us truly as colorful as we think?

In the "Light Laboratory," you'll experience firsthand how the perception of color varies depending on the lighting conditions. Colors will shift and transform under different lighting, sometimes even disappearing altogether...

The installation will be accompanied by music composed by Jakub Czapliński, known as Mr. Upgrade.
