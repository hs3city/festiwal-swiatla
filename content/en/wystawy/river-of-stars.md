In Japanese culture, the Tanabata Festival, or the Stars in the Sky Festival, is celebrated annually. During the celebrations, the Japanese decorate their surroundings with handmade paper and bamboo decorations and write wishes on slips of paper.

Fume Ito Matters' artwork is inspired by this festival, and the Milky Way, translated in Japanese as the "river of heaven." The piece combines imaginative depictions of the night sky with the literal symbolism of the river, reflecting the cycle of day and night. The work is complemented by a projection on layers of fabric suspended above the visitors, creating a sense of unity between the sky and water that connects the entire world.
