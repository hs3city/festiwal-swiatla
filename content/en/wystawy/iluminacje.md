Illuminations is an ongoing painting series that we had the privilege to feature in last year's Festival of Light. This year, we're presenting its continuation. The series consists of diptychs and triptychs depicting the same arrangement in different lighting. The artist crafts compositions using glass objects, which she illuminates with light sources of different intensities and hues. She captures these setups through photography and then translates these images into her paintings.


The core objective of Illuminations is to highlight the transformative power of light on our perception. Light stands as the sole variable within the artist's compositions. Without altering the camera's position or the arrangement of the objects, the artist unveils fresh interpretations from the same elements. Light penetrates through transparent objects, casts reflections, refracts, and produces glimmers, glares, and distortions.
