clue. is a series of luminous objects powered by an algorithm utilizing fluid randomness. The animation encapsulated within each object is generative which means that each frame of this organic, color-radiating visualization is generated by the algorithm, making it almost unique. The animation code draws inspiration from the distinct painting style of the 20th-century Polish artist Wojciech Fangor. The chromatic ballet of clue. mesmerizes and allows the viewer to immerse into its tranquil sequence.
