The digits "0" and "1" are the components of binary code, a numerical system used in all computer systems, processors, and RAM and ROM memories. In Dominika Wiltos' paintings, much like in technology, rows of zeros and ones form a message.Binary codes merge with the imagery, creating well-known and frustrating error messages â€“ "Error," "No Connection," "Not Found." Messages familiar from the computer screen become a metaphor for human problems, fears, and blocks that, although often unconscious, can impact entire life. By uncovering these elements, we can break through dysfunctional patterns and consciously shape our lives.
 
The gold used in the paintings symbolizes sincerity and authenticity. It is a metaphorical light leading to the gradual discovery of the truth about oneself.
