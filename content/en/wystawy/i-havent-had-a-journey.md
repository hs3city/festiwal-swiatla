I haven't had a journey like this in a while is a visual representation of the relationship between the Sun and the Moon. Just like in nature, in Maciej Kryński's work, the Moon exists only because it reflects the light of the Sun. In the morning, the Sun rises, a new day begins, and the wild dance of the Sun and the Moon starts anew.

The installation is constructed of metal elements in the form of a free interpretation of the letter “Y”. “Sun” and “Moon” (point reflector and mirror) are mounted at separate ends of the installation.
