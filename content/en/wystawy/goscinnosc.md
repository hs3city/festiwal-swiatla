At Hackerspace Trójmiasto, we're all about experiments, so our exhibition will feature gadgets crafted by members and friends of HS3 as part of our light exploration. Expect to see various facets of light technology – from microcontrollers and electronics to 3D printing. You'll find there game called Evil Submarine, which snagged the audience award at this year's Game Jam hackathon, along with other wild projects. We won't just showcase our gadgets, we'll also share tips on how to create your own at home!
