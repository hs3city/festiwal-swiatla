"Wędrówka światła" is a series of solargraph photographs. The solargraphy technique involves long-term exposure of photosensitive paper using a pinhole camera, also known as a Camera Obscura. This method is surprising and mysterious. It's impossible to precisely set the frame or predict the final effect of the photograph. Each execution requires patience above all, as the exposure process lasts from several weeks to a year.
