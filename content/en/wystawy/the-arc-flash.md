The Shipyard. Vast plains of steel bathed in a haze of smoke and dust, intermittently illuminated by explosions of an electric arc fountain of sparks, molten lava of melting steel, mysterious corridors and nooks intersected by beams of light seeping from cracks. Michał Mackiewicz's work seeks to capture the and luminous impression of distinctive shipyard sceneries, blending the experiences of a shipyard welder with the perspective of an artist.
The installation consists of four geometric, steel sculptures resembling parts of a ship under construction. Raw, industrial objects will be illuminated from both outside and inside by narrow beams of light, mimicking the lights accompanying the welding process. Small mirrors, lenses, and prisms are embedded on the sculptures' surfaces, allowing viewers to refract, redirect, and multiply beams of light, creating their own unique and ephemeral compositions.
The sculpture will be accompanied by the artist's signature sound, in the form of ambient compositions created from sound samples of the Ostrów island.
Michał Mackiewicz is an audiovisual artist and an active welder. The artist's sensitivity allows him to discern the striking and raw beauty found within shipyards. Mackiewicz is captivated by light installations, theatrical lighting, and interior architectural design. He has contributed soundscapes and lighting designs to a variety of theatrical productions, both as a creator and live performer. His works have been exhibited in Poland, Lithuania, Germany, Hungary, and Norway.
