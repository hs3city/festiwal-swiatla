The opening of Jadwiga Hajdo's exhibition in Foodhall Montownia scheduled for May 8th will be a prelude to the third edition of the Festival of Light. The event will be filled with LIGHT, MOVEMENT, and SOUND. Jadwiga Hajdo will whisk us away to a fairy tale realm with her energetic, fluorescent paintings, which come alive under UV light, transforming Montownia's space into a mystical wonderland.

Adding to the ambiance, Robert Usewicz, known as the Sound Navigator, will enchant us with the soothing sounds of the harp. The dance performance of Duet Luna, gracefully moving with luminous wings, will seamlessly blend the light of the paintings with the harp's melodies.

The vernissage offers a unique opportunity to witness how light reshapes our perception of reality and how sound ignites our imagination, transporting us to a wholly new, intangible dimension.
