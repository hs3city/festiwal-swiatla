Camera Obscura is a simple photographic device that can be made from a cardboard box or a can. Jacek Ożóg, however, had a more unconventional approach. He fashioned his Camera Obscura from... a Volkswagen Transporter. The project Through the Streets of the Old Town of Gdańsk consists of images taken with this wheeled camera. Over four months, the artist documented the city's ancient streets using a 1.2mm aperture in the van's back door. As he puts it, the greatest satisfaction came from the fact that he could be inside the camera while taking the photos. This allowed him to simultaneously expose the photographic papers from which negatives were made and work in the darkroom on the positives. The result of the project are unique, enchanting images of old Gdańsk.
