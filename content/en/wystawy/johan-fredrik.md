Interactive light-installation showcasing that light, art and science can merge together to become something playful, engaging and inclusive. The work encourages visitors to engage in a hands-on experience, exploring the colours and patterns that appear when white light breaks through prisms. The installation comes to life through audience engagement, fostering an ongoing performance where visitors take centre stage, actively shaping and creating the light-art themselves.
The work is composed of a rotatable plate with 21 cube shaped glass prisms and a light source with white light. When white light breaks through the prisms all colours emerge from the colour spectrum. These colours and patterns are being projected on the plate and the surrounding environment, creating a 360-degree immersive experience for the visitors.
