## Bio

A member of Hackerspace Trójmiasto, an architect by profession and a visionary by passion. On a daily basis faces challenges of contemporary architecture while designing buildings, public spaces, service facilities, and healthcare establishments.
Privately, she has a shared history with Robert Proch, a former classmate and colleague whose talent and dedication to excellence inspired her to nurture her own artistic passions and pursue architecture as her professional path. Her goal is to master programming to independently realize her creative visions. Currently, she gratefully depends on the support of her fantastic friends from Hackerspace Trójmiasto, whose coding skills bring her boldest ideas for artistic installations to life.
