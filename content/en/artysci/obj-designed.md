## Bio

The brand was founded by two design students from the Gdańsk Academy of Fine Arts, classmates and roommates - Kajetan and Jacek. Between their rooms in a rented apartment in Dolne Miasto, there is a dressing room that serves as their production hub. They strive to design consciously, drawing inspiration from the design of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly from glass products of that era.
