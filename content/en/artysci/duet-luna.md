## Bio

Duet Luna consists of two friends who, for over a decade, have shared a deep passion for both dance and technology. Their dance repertoire is oriental-focused, ranging from classical and folk styles to fusion and show. Together, they began to explore a variety of dance styles, and experimenting with props such as silk veils, fans, and wings. They not only create their own choreographies but also design their costumes. Their unique choreographies, blending oriental dance with elements from other styles, have garnered recognition at numerous festivals and competitions both in Poland and internationally.
