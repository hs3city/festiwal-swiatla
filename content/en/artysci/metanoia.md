## Bio

Metanoia creatives is a group of interdisciplinary artists and creative technologists from the Czech Republic. The collective formed through collaborations on various multimedia projects, from videomappings to light installations. They worked for diverse Czech and foreign clients and light festivals: Dublin Winter Lights festival 2023, the Blik Blik festival in Pilsen, Czech design week in Prague or the Ars Electronica festival in Linz. The interdisciplinary character of the group allows them to explore different digital audiovisual techniques, from creative coding and generative art, through all forms of classic and digital animation, 3D graphics, sound design, and many more.
