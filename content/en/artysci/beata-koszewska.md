## Bio

Beata Koszewska is an artist and a woman of incredible strength. Together with her husband, she founded the Art Gemelli jewelry workshop, specializing in exclusive, artistic jewelry. In her personal life, she has overcome and continues to overcome many challenges. She experienced a premature birth due to a brain hemorrhage and gave birth to twin daughters affected by cerebral palsy. Taking care of her daughters consumes most of her time, and painting became a form of therapy for her.

Art is a path to discover herself, better understand her emotions, and accept and love herself. Creating allows her to maintain balance and care for her well-being, as well as the well-being of her family, because a happy and fulfilled mother is the key to her children's happiness.
