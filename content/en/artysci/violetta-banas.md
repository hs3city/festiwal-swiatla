## Bio

In her professional life, she thrives as a specialist technology designer, but outside of work, she's always on the lookout for captivating photographic moments in her surroundings.
She regularly uses a DSLR camera with interchangeable lenses, delving into a wide range of interests from aerial and sports photography to automotive, night shots, and capturing atmospheric phenomena like storms and auroras. She also has a penchant for using older, non-electronic cameras, such as box or pinhole cameras.
If she finds herself without a camera at hand, she can craft one from a matchbox or a soda can. It's her handcrafted cameras and the unique opportunities they offer that sparked her fascination with negative photography, known as solarigraphy.
