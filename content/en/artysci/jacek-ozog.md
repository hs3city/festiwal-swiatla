## Bio

Jacek Ożóg is a graduate of the Sopot School of Photography and a winner of numerous photography competitions. While he works in fashion photography professionally, his true passion lies in analog photography. He perceives the world through frames, creating images that are essentially images painted with light, capturing the world as seen through the eyes of the photographer.
