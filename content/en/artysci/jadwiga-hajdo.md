## Bio

Jadwiga Hajdo, an artist with over 40 years of experience, embarked on her artistic journey through teaching and childcare. Her passion for painting evolved outside conventional boundaries, guided by intuition and observations of the natural world.
Following her move to a small town in the Polish countryside in 2008,  surrounded by golden fields and wild forests,she found inspiration to develop her unique dotting technique. Enthralled by dewdrops on leaves, she developped this method, and the discovery of UV paint effects added a whole new dimension to her work. UV paints have now become her distinctive hallmark.
