## Bio

Olga Wardęga (Poland) and Christoph Zeckel (Germany/Malaysia) are a duo of artists and travelers who collaborate on live performances, site-specific installations, and audiovisual works across Portugal, Poland, Estonia, and Sweden. Their latest installations offer somatic, immersive experiences based on the re-materialization and morphing of organic, physical objects and sounds in the digital realm, which they display on unconventional surfaces using large-format projections.
