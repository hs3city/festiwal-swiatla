# We connect people through light

Light plays a huge role in our lives. Without the sun, life on earth would not be possible at all, and subsequent inventions of man, such as an oil lamp, light bulb or laser, drive the development of civilisation.

Since the dawn of time, light has fascinated people, and its study has enabled the progress of science and culture. Therefore, on May 16, the anniversary of the first successful use of the laser, we celebrate [the International Day of Light established by UNESCO](https://www.lightday.org/) . In the Tri-City, we will celebrate light throughout the weekend - **13 and 14 May** Festival of Light will turn Góra Gradowa into the most illuminated point on the map of Poland for the second time.

We invite you to participate in an event whose main character will be light. Broadly understood light. The Festival of Light will be an opportunity for scientific experiments, artistic expression and, above all, good fun. The program includes a whole spectrum of attractions - numerous shows, exhibitions and workshops that will show light ... in a completely new light.
