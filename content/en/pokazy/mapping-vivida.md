Vivida isn't merely a finished artwork, it's an ongoing journey. It reflects a path inspired by light and its transformative power over space around us, where us refers to the audience. It evolves from a tranquil, monochromatic entre√© into a dance of vibrant particles of colour. Its movement harmonizes with the viewer's thoughts, celebrating the moment of peace illuminated by light.
