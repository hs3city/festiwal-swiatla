Do different colors of light carry different amounts of energy? If so, which color carries the most, and which carries the least? Discover the mysterious relationship between light and electricity and learn about the phenomenon of photoelectric effect. Maciej Wierzbowski from Hackerspace Trójmiasto will discuss how Einstein uncovered the quantum nature of light and replicate the experiment demonstrating that light is not only a wave but also a stream of particles. Together, we will delve into the history of light research and conduct a groundbreaking experiment showing that light can generate electric current and why it does so.
