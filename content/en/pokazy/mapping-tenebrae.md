Tenebrism is an artistic concept that originated during the Baroque era, closely associated with artists like Caravaggio. This style of painting is characterised by the intense use of chiaroscuro, which creates striking contrasts between light and dark within a composition. In tenebrist artworks, subjects are frequently illuminated by a powerful light source against a dark backdrop, evoking a heightened sense of drama and emotional intensity. Tenebrae, on the other hand, is a Latin term signifying “darkness” or “shadows.” It finds its usage in a religious context, specifically in reference to Christian religious services of Passion. 
For the artists, Tenebrae combines the dynamic correlation of light and shadow. The dramatic imagery casts a mesmerising spell that draws us closer to the artistry of the past. It is through these captivating contrasts that she finds her inspiration, paying homage to the timeless traditions of yesteryears while forging her own unique artistic path.
