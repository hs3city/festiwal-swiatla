Nicola Pavone, a DJ, videomapper, and a visual-sound artist, will take uas on a magical journey to the realm of colours. The artist will present a DJ set with live mapping. His performance entitled Dance of Colours is an invitation to join the game of giving visible shape to the invisible.

An explosion of lights creates the universe that we know and inhabit ("Let there be light", Genesis 1:3). Invisible things are also born from this cosmic dance, and are filled with the same Energy that created them. Energy and curiosity are two forces that push everything towards connection, whether itâ€™s a connection between people or a data network; and connection is the hallmark of our contemporary life, it is the way our mind operates. It is for this reason that when admiring the night sky we can recognize the constellations, that remind us that, just like the stars, we too come from the deep, sparkling darkness of the cosmos.
