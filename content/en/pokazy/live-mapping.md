"Dance of Colours” takes the viewer into the game of giving visible shape to the invisible. An explosion of lights creates the universe that we know and inhabit ("Let there be light", Genesis 1:3) , and invisible things are also born from this cosmic dance, which are filled with the same Energy that created them.
Energy and curiosity push everything towards connection, whether it’s a connection between people or a data network; and connection is the hallmark of our contemporary life, it is the way our mind operates. It is for this reason that when admiring the night sky we can recognize and admire the constellations, which remind us that, just like the stars, we too come from the deep, sparkling darkness of the cosmos.
