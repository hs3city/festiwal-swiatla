Experience a captivating dance performance featuring the wings of the Egyptian goddess Isis, illuminated with vibrant colors. Audiences will witness two simultaneous choreographies: one prepared by the dancers and the other by the lights dancing on their transparent LED wings. The performance gains an extra dimension through the lens of the camera, capturing stunning images painted with light and motion.
The Epic Led Wings Dance Show project is a fusion of the creators' shared passion for dance and technology. Crafting the props for this performance presented a significant challenge, demanding interdisciplinary skills in sewing and programming.
