"True Colours" showcases the beauty of diversity through visuals and sounds. Spectators take part in the creation of an entertaining, funny and colourful world of sound and images.
At the beginning, there is darkness and silence. Little by little the hands appear. Hands of people from various backgrounds, ages, genders. Each time a new pair of hands appears, a new window, an interesting colour, and sound comes into play. The hands bring them to life just by moving  â€” clapping, snapping, pushing, pointing, playing small instruments, and so on. The melody becomes increasingly complex with each new sound. The rhythm gets you: Colour has power.
