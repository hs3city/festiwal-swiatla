The Laser Harp is an innovative musical instrument that emits sounds using laser beams. Thanks to it, Joanna Zubrycka's concert will be a feast not only for the ears but also for the eyes. The artist and producer, operating under the pseudonym Miss God, will present original compositions combining traditional Eastern music with the sounds of modern electronics. Miss God's hypnotic concert, full of deep and mystical tones, will transport the audience to the mysterious world of ancient cultural traditions.

The artist draws inspiration from the traditions of Polish, Bulgarian, and Ukrainian ancient songs, which she arranges in a modern, electronic form. She is passionate about experimenting with various musical genres and merging them into unique compositions. Her work invites the listener to explore new spaces and depths of sound, rich in layers that seamlessly blend to create spatial sound textures for the audience to immerse in.

The laser harp, on which Miss God will play, not only generates sounds but also creates visual effects. The light emitted by the instrument will be synchronized with the music, producing captivating visualizations.
