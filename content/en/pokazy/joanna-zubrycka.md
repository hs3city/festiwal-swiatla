The Laser Harp is an innovative musical instrument that emits sounds using laser beams. Thanks to it, Joanna Zubrycka's concert will be a feast not only for the ears but also for the eyes. The artist and producer, operating under the pseudonym Miss God, will present original compositions combining traditional Eastern music with the sounds of modern electronics. Miss God's hypnotic concert, full of deep and mystical tones, will transport the audience to the mysterious world of ancient cultural traditions.
