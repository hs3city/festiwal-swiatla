Sunsets serve as a natural antidepressant. That transitional moment between day and night, when the light shifts dramatically and the sky transforms into a stage for a colourful spectacle, has a profoundly calming and tranquillising impact on those who witness it.
A particular Friday sunset inspired Bartosz Pieczyński to record a mini-album titled "Friday Evening," which is an instrumental interpretation of the sunset. The track is complemented by a video showcasing the mesmerising sight of the setting sun.
