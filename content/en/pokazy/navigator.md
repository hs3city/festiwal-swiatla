Robert Usewicz (Navigator Dźwięku) is an exceptional artist whose life path has led him through the labyrinths of popular music to the discovery of the profound power of sound and inner light. His journey commenced at a pinnacle of experience, where he uncovered a new realm—the world of Sacred Sounds—and dedicated himself to exploring the mysteries of ancient instruments and seeking new sonic expressions.

The discovery of the power of the gong became the focal point of his creativity, guiding him into the role of a healer on inner voyages. The Harp of the Navigator materializes his vision and serves as a tool for transformation and sonic communication for humanity.
