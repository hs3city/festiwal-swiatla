The “Senior Wellfare - Light on Plants” workshop focuses on the need to increase seniors' social and physical activity, an important aspect of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in old age. By engaging seniors in therapeutic cultivation of both spring and non-spring plants, the project creates an attractive form of spending time that promotes social integration.

During the meeting, we will talk about pocket forests, also known as Miyawaki forests, and dr. Kasper Jakubowski will present the achievements and possibilities of cooperation with the FOREST MAKER organization. We will also showcase short films prepared by participants of the Third Age Academy at the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications, and Informatics at the Gdańsk University of Technology.
