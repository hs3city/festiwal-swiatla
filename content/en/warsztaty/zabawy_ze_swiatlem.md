**Workshop for children 6+**

Do you have a little scientist at home? Sign your child up for the "Playing with Light" workshops prepared by scientists from the Łukasiewicz Institute! Together we will manipulate light - bend its ray, split it and debate whether it has a wave or particle nature. During the workshop we will make our own rainbow - we will try to split sunlight and show how beautiful colors make up white light. We will also build a micro microscope ourselves! We will create a lens from a glass of water ("half full" of course). We will also touch the phenomenon of diffraction (i.e. deflection of light) and we will observe it using our own eyebrows and a professional bench with a laser.

The workshop is conducted by **[the Łukasiewicz Research Network - IMiF](https://imif.lukasiewicz.gov.pl/)**

**The workshop will be in Polish**


**Saturday 11:00, 12:00, 13:00, 14:00 and 15:00**

Duration: 20 min

**Free tickets to pick up at the info point on the day of the event.**
