Workshops led by Magdalena Przychodzeń (Vida Verde) offer an inspiring opportunity where you not only craft a unique soy candle with a personal intention but also delve into the mystery of the numerological potential of your birth date. Each individual carries within their personal data a set of different digit arrangements, which serve as the driving force behind everything that unfolds in their life.
Throughout the workshops, you will uncover how your birth date influences you, your decisions, and your environment. Additionally, you will gain knowledge and access to materials necessary for creating an essential oil-infused soy candle adorned with dried plants.
The workshops are organized in collaboration with Food Hall Montownia.
