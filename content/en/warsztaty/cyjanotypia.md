Cyanotype was invented by John Herschel in 1842 and is the first photographic technique to utilize the concept of negatives and positives. The most famous artwork using this method is a botanical album created in 1843 by Anna Atkins, recognized as the first female photographer. Her work served as inspiration for our workshops. During the sessions, you'll create your own interpretation of a botanical album using plants found in the area.
During the workshop, you'll learn about the origins of photography and delve into the captivating cyanotype process. You'll learn how to apply light-sensitive emulsion to paper and arrange collected leaves and flowers to compose your artwork. Following exposure to sunlight, you'll develop your creations in water. The finished photogram will become a unique decoration to take home.*


*Participants will have the opportunity to exhibit their creations during the Light Festival in a specially prepared space called "Hospitality".
The workshop is conducted by Agnieszka Piasecka.
