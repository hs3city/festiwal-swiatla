In this site-specific audiovisual installation, the duo explores how the Kreenholm Textile Manufacture, once full of life, now empty and abandoned, persists in the collective memory of the region. Their work shows the fate of the empty buildings, left behind and given over to ever persisting nature. 
The artists document what remained using sound and light as mediums.
