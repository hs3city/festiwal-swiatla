What if you could experience what it's like to feel, embody and express your inner light in a creative way? How would it look? What could you do with it?
Dancer and artist, Esther Kasenda, invites all those who love to move their bodies and are open to new experiences to her workshops. Through dance we will explore the power hidden in movement in a fun and artistic way. The workshops will include elements of contemporary dance, traditional African dance, and intuitive movement techniques that will help you find a natural, free-flowing rhythm of expression.
Join the fun! No previous dance experience is required. People of all ages are welcome, starting from 16 years old (or from 10 under parental supervision).
