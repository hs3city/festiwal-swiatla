We're shedding light on light! Join us as we uncover its true nature. We'll disperse white light into colors and create glasses  that allow you to see the world in all the colors of the rainbow.

Free workshop tickets will be available at the information desk on the day of the event.

Organizer: The Aleksander Jabłoński Foundation is a non-governmental organization supporting the Faculty of Physics, Astronomy, and Applied Informatics and the Institute of Astronomy at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, and co-implementing their development strategy.
